# Face-mask-detecion-using-deep-learning

A deep learning based model for detecting masks over faces in public place to curtail community spread of Coronavirus is presented. The proposed model efficiently handles varying kinds of occlusions in dense situation by making use of ensemble of single and two stage detectors. The ensemble approach not only helps in achieving high accuracy but also improves detection speed considerably. The model is 98.2% accurate at mask detection with average inference times of 0.05 seconds per image.

We have used pretained ImageNet and FaceNet models.
